This is a fully functional Google Search project made purely with HTML and CSS.
This page contains three pages of - Google Search, Image Search & Advanced Google Search.

These pages are linked of one another, links of which can be found on the upper-right corner of the pages.
The Image and Advanced Search have links to the Google Search page, the Google Search page has links of both the pages as mentioned before.
The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button is also functional, that is to say that it displays the first link which appears on the regular searches.
If the button is clicked with no input it will redirect to the first Google Search page.
